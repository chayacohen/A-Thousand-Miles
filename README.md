## Background and Overview 

A Thousand Miles is a roadtrip planning web application that allows users to plan a trip through interactively drawing on a map. Users can create custom itineraries and add their favorite attractions.

## How does it work?

A Thousand Miles' goal is to give the user an easy way to find attractions to visit when planning a road trip or vacation. Users will be able to create and account, log in, or sign in with a demo user. Once the user logs in, they will be prompted to create an itinerary for their trip. The user can then put in their starting address (defaulted to the address entered during sign up) and final destination. Users will then be able to draw a line on their map that represents the general path they would like to travel. Once the line is drawn, a list of tourist attraction location near the line will be available for the user to add to their itineray.
